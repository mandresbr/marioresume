            Hello, My name is <strong>Mario Bola√±os</strong>. I am a Full Stack Developer and a Computer Science and Systems Engineering student at <strong>Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali</strong> (PUJ). I am interested in a wide variety of domains in Computer Science, but regardless of what I am working on, my focus is designing high quality, practical, readable, and maintainable code.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a student, I have worked on many <strong>school projects</strong> that are related with several programming languages. I have worked on numerous <strong>personal software projects</strong>.
            If you would like to learn more about the work I've done, please check out the rest of my website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a life outside of Computer Science! I love the balance in my life that my family, traveling, sports, video games, working out, and programming brings to myself. I'm really proud of having my girlfriend in my life, she is my everything.
            
          </P>
          <p>
